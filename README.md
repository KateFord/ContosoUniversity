# Contoso University

A Visual Studio project, developed by Microsoft, to demonstrate how to use the Entity Framework in an ASP.NET MVC 5 web application 
project, using the Code First architecture. I worked on this project leading up to the Live Project at The Tech Academy.

### The code includes the following:
* Performing basic CRUD operations.
* Razor to access ASP.NET helper methods.
* Working with related data and filtering, ordering, and grouping.
* Using command interception.
* Writing async code and handling concurrency.
* Implementing table-per-hierarchy inheritance.
* Creating a data model using data annotations attributes, and fluent API for database mapping.
* Performing raw SQL queries and no-tracking queries.
* Working with proxy classes.
* Disabling both the automatic detection of changes and the validation when saving changes.
